@article{Chambon2018,
abstract = {Birds exhibit a range of wintering behaviour from strictly migrant to strictly resident species. In partially migrating ones, some birds overwinter within their breeding region (resident birds) while others, although breeding in the same area, winter far away (migrant birds). Accordingly, choosing a wintering region is a key stage in the annual life cycle of birds, notably for inexperienced first-year individuals. The present study aimed to investigate this issue, and more specifically to study the distribution pattern during winter and factors influencing the wintering behaviour of first-year pied avocets Recurvirostra avosetta. Based on a 10-yr ringing study carried out on five of the major French breeding colonies distributed along the Atlantic coast, we showed the coexistence of different wintering tactics. The resident tactic was predominant (approximately 86% of the 575 birds re-sighted), while the other birds adopted migration. Among resident individuals, two different tactics occurred: 43% of birds overwintered within their natal colony, whereas the others wintered in another site located at relatively close proximity along the French Atlantic coast. Hatching date was a consistent predictor of all wintering tactics. More specifically, the probability of migrating was the highest for early-hatched birds, and for resident ones, the probability of wintering within their natal colony rather than in another French site was the highest for both median- and late-hatched individuals. In addition, a colony effect was demonstrated for resident birds. Several biological interpretations, including social system, variations in both individual body condition and habitat quality, were put forward to explain these correlates.},

abstract = {Recoveries of 440 Avocets ringed in Denmark were analysed to describe the migration pattern of the Danish population throughout the year. The overall recovery rate is 3.4%, with the recovery rate for birds ringed as adults being larger than the recovery rate for birds ringed as chicks (23.9% vs. 3.1%). The mortality of the Danish population reached 57.8% during the first year of life and 32% for older birds. Danish Avocets are truly migratory; the first birds leave Denmark in August and most birds have left the country by October. Most recoveries are from France (60%), Spain (12%) and Portugal (16%), especially at coastal wetlands along the Atlantic seaboard. No difference was found between young and old birds with respect to winter quarters. The return migration to the Danish breeding grounds occurs in March. Adult birds showed a higher rate of return to their ringing area (70%) than birds ringed as chicks (38%). {\textcopyright} 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},
